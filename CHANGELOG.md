## [Unreleased]

## [2.0.0]

### Added
- adds `CHANGELOG.md`

### Changed
- changes plugin logic to attach moment to the `self` validation time variable, which allows for plugin use without `passContext` or needing to call validate bound to an external context containing a reference to moment (thanks @epoberezkin)
- refactors codebase to use `babel`
